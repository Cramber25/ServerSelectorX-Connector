# How often the connector plugin sends placeholders, in seconds.
# If you have multiple servers, the plugin will ping all servers within this time,
# with a roughly consistent interval. For example:
# send-interval 4 / 2 addresses = every 2 seconds sending data to a
# server, so each server will get data every 4 seconds
# IMPORTANT: If you change this, you must also change the server offline timeout
# in the ServerSelectorX api.yml configuration file

# If you have a lot of placeholders, send data very frequently and/or send data to many servers,
# collecting placeholders can take a long time and affect server performance.
# You can fix this by requesting some placeholders less often and requesting placeholders
# asynchronously where possible.

# Cache placeholders for some amount of seconds. Set to 0 to disable caching.
# This improves performance by requesting placeholders less frequently.

#cache:
#  placeholdername: 10

# Retrieve some placeholders asynchronously. They will be requested separate from
# the main server thread, which means that even if it takes long to request a placeholder
# it won't affect server performance. Use with caution, not all placeholders can be requested
# async. Since placeholders are read-only most placeholders should be fine. If you get weird console
# errors after adding placeholders here, remove them.

# - placeholdername

# Default cache duration in seconds. Increasing this helps with lag when sending data to many
